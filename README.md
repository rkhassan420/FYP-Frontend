## 🎯 Overview

The **AI Content Evaluator** addresses a critical challenge in modern education: as AI tools become ubiquitous, distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated academic work has become increasingly difficult.

This platform provides:

- 🔍 **AI vs Human authorship detection** at document and paragraph level
- ✏️ **Grammar & linguistic analysis** with correction suggestions
- 📊 **Comprehensive annotated PDF reports** with color-coded feedback
- 👥 **Role-based interfaces** for Students, Teachers, Admins, and Guests
- ⚡ **Async processing** with Redis queues and multiple ML workers
